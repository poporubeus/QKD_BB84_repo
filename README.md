## Noise simulation inside BB84 protocol
# Quantum computing project

BB84 protocol is a quantum algorithm ideated by Bertrand and Brassard aimed to generate quantum key distribution for Cryptography used for quantum communications.
The idea is that two parties want to communicate with a quantum device and should send strings of bit encoded in many qubits that represent the encryption and decryption keys used by them. By doing this, the communication process acquires security because every time an eavesdropper tries to have access to the content of the message leaves a trace on it, with a resulting detection by the receiver. The problem of making use of a device of this type, in addition to not being fully realized yet, is that quantum communication is always affected by noise respectively generated by the quantum circuit itself.

In this project a simulation of the noise is realized in Qiskit and can be understood by following the line of code shared on the notebook.

Libraries used:
1. qiskit;
2. numpy;
3. matplotlib.pyplot;
4. seaborn.
